# Text-processing
Claccification based BERT-like (KNN)
Task: implement a classification task based on a BERT-like model and KNN on the Russian Intents Dataset from Kaggle.

Create text classifiers in the context of a large number of small classes consisting of short texts.

Result: code for creating a search vector index + logic for determining a class based on proximity to training objects (by closest, by top-N closest, etc.).
